Hey,

This is Alka and I work as a Team Lead in Accenture India. My journey is quite straightforward. I did my Bachelors in Technology from Saroj Mohan Institute of Technology, West Bengal. My college was in a small town. So, along with my studies I got to know the importance of stoic lifestyle. <br />

I was then campus selected in IBM where I worked my next 4 years. This is where I learnt the basics of corporate world, EDI, EAI, project management in general.   There was a time when I started feeling stagnant and wanted growth in terms of money and technology.
Accenture came up with an offer I could not refuse and since then I have been working for Accenture and have got a wide experience in different tools and technologies since then.
Recently, I got a certification “AWS cloud Developer – Associate” because I was interested in the same and I would like to continue with my career in the same field.
