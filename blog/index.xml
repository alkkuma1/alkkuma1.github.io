      <description>Hey,
This is Alka and I work as a Team Lead in Accenture India. My journey is quite straightforward. I did my Bachelors in Technology from Saroj Mohan Institute of Technology, West Bengal. My college was in a small town. So, along with my studies I got to know the importance of stoic lifestyle. I was then campus selected in IBM where I worked my next 4 years. This is where I learnt the basics of corporate world, EDI, EAI, project management in general.</description>
